# üß™ Experiments

This repository is a collection of experimental and failed projects that might've not quite worked out but have taught me something valuable along the way.

Each folder contains its own self-contained mini-project, README, and code. Some of these were attempts at big ideas, some were technical prototypes, and others were just for fun. They might be broken, incomplete, or weird and that‚Äôs kind of the point.

## Why This Repo Exists

- To document my learning process with failures and all
- To keep a log of ideas that I might revisit later
- To share challenges and lessons with others
- To show that not everything has to be polished to be worth sharing

## üìÅ Included Projects

### [`autotune/`](autotune)
Real-time and post-processing auto-tune experiments using Python.  
Attempted to live-tune a vocal input and mix it with a backing track.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Status:** Partially functional, but real-time version failed due to latency and audio artifacts.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

Each folder is its own project. To run anything:

1. `cd` into the project folder (e.g., `cd autotune`)
2. For python projects create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. For other types of projects check README.md file that is included in the project folder
